        Our homepage offers a visually engaging experience that sells the platform to our users. 
        Additionally, the ‘Annual Picks' page provides insights into the year’s most influential musicians. 
        We also introduce users to discover new music daily with our ‘Showcase' feature. 
        Name idea and concept is roughly inspired from ITP-310 classmate Melody Chou">

                    <p class>
                        Frank Ocean's "Pyramids" from his 2012 album "Channel Orange" is a musical journey that beautifully combines R&B, soul, and electronic elements. 
                        Clocking in at nearly 10 minutes, the song's intricate production, ranging from smooth synths to funky guitar riffs, creates an immersive experience. 
                        With its vivid storytelling and Ocean's soulful vocals, "Pyramids" stands out as a modern masterpiece, offering a unique blend of nostalgia and futurism that transcends genre boundaries.

                    <p>
                        Isabelle Huang's "Itch" is a mesmerizing Mandopop track that beautifully captures romantic longing. 
                        Huang’s soulful vocals, combined with the song’s lush and energetic composition, create a unique blend that leaves a lasting impression. 
                        The lyrics, which depict a gentle beam of a setting sun and a sea of blue bright sky, are a testament to Huang’s musical versatility and evocative singing ability.

                    <p>
                        “Hello?” by Clairo and Reggie Snow is a captivating track that beautifully explores the complexities of a romance strained by physical and emotional separation. 
                        The song’s self-produced instrumental, featuring a simple two-chord synth loop and a bouncy drum beat, is reminiscent of Clairo’s previous SoundCloud hit "Flaming Hot Cheetos". 
                        Clairo’s tender vocals paired with Reggie Snow’s reflective verses create a unique blend of indie pop and lo-fi alternative pop that leaves a lasting impression

                <h3>Company Values</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><h4>**Innovation**</h4></li>
                    We strive to push the boundaries of technology and design, creating a unique and forward-thinking music experience.</li>
                    <li><h4>**Passion for Music*</h4></li>
                    We are deeply passionate about music and committed to supporting artists and fans alike.
                    <li><h4>**User-Centric**</h4></li>
                    We prioritize our users' needs and experiences, constantly seeking feedback and making improvements.
                    <li><h4>**Diversity and Inclusion**</h4></li>
                    We celebrate all genres of music and aim to represent artists from diverse backgrounds and cultures.
                    <li><h4>**Integrity**</h4></li>
                    We operate with transparency and honesty, building trust with our users and partners.
                    <li><h4>**Collaboration**</h4></li>
                    We believe in the power of collaboration, both within our team and with our users and artists.
                    <li><h4>**Continuous Learning**</h4></li>
                    We are committed to learning and growing, staying abreast of the latest trends in music and technology.
                    <li><h4>**Sustainability**</h4></li>
                    We are mindful of our impact on the environment and strive to make sustainable choices in our operations.
                </ol>
             

                <h3>Future Goals</h3>

                <h4>Spotify and SoundCloud Integrations</h4>
                <p>
                    We would like to develop a unified music discovery feature that allows users to pull song recommendations 
                    from all linked music platforms, giving them a chance to create and manage playlists which pull from each platforms' best titles.
                    This would leverage the recommendation algorithms of each platform, providing users with a diverse range of tailored music suggestions and create a seamless music listening experience.. 
                    It would also give users the flexibility to mix and match songs from different sources, expanding their music discovery possibilities.
                </p>

                <h4>Social Features</h4>
                <p>
                    We also would like to create a feature that allows artists to share updates, behind-the-scenes content, and interact with fans directly on the app. 
                    This could include live chats during performances, Q&A sessions, or even virtual meet-and-greets.
                    We foresee implementing features that encourage community interaction, such as user-created public playlists, song voting systems, and discussion boards. 
                    This would allow users to connect over shared musical interests and foster a sense of community within the app.
                </p>

                <h4>Cross-Platform Expansion and Offline Mode</h4>
                <p>
                    Lastly, we aim to expand the app to other platforms such as iOS, Android, and smart TVs to reach a wider audience (coming soon with iFrames). 
                    Additionally, we want to implement an offline mode that allows users to download songs and listen to them without an 
                    internet connection, making the app more accessible and convenient for users with limited or intermittent
                    internet access.

                Do not use class examples, labs, or assignments with modified content.
                Do not use HTML templates found online.
                Not adhering to this will result in a zero (0) score on this assignment and the final project.
            Clean and readable design.
            Clear purpose and topic.
            Topic must be different from your assignments and labs.
            Substantial and real content.
            No lorem ipsum or image-fillers.
            Good balance between text and graphics:
            Do not create a text-only or an image-only page.

            1. Navigation or menu with links to other pages or sections.
            2. Each menu option must be a clickable link.
            3. Links do not have to take users anywhere yet.
            4. <meta> description tag with 100-350 characters.
                Keep it descriptive yet concise.
                Simply “Tommy Trojan’s Final Project” is not acceptable.
            5. Intuitive User Interface (UI):
                Clickable elements should be clearly marked, etc.
